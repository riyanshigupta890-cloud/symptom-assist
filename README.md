# SymptomAssist AI 🩺


SymptomAssist AI is a neuro-symbolic medical assistant that combines:

- Structured reasoning over a symptom-condition knowledge graph
- Retrieval-augmented context from curated medical documents
- Conversational response generation through an LLM

It is designed for educational triage support, not clinical diagnosis.

## Latest Updates ✨

- Added accessible modal workflows for New Chat and Visit Summary dialogs ♿
- Improved summary tooling with copy, print, and PDF export support 📄
- Improved diagnostics UX with richer condition confidence and checklist views 📊
- Strengthened graph visualization state handling and responsive rerender behavior 🕸️
- Added better frontend structure via shared header/control styles 🧩

## Core Features 🚀

- Knowledge graph traversal using symptom-to-condition edges 🧠
- Red-flag symptom detection for urgent guidance 🚨
- RAG grounding from domain-specific medical documents 📚
- Conversation memory via session timeline support 🕒
- Explainable diagnostics panel with confidence and contribution data 🔍
- Visit-ready summary generation for clinician handoff 📝

## Architecture 🏗️

The app uses a layered pipeline:

1. NLP extractor parses user symptom text.
2. Knowledge graph scores candidate conditions.
3. RAG pipeline retrieves matching medical context.
4. LLM composes grounded, user-friendly guidance.
5. Frontend renders diagnostics and graph state updates.

For a full architecture walkthrough, see [SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Repository Structure 📁

- `app/`: FastAPI backend and reasoning pipeline
- `data/`: CSV datasets and local vector store artifacts
- `static/`: Frontend HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- `tests/`: Automated tests
- `scratch/`: Local experiments and debug scripts
- `.github/workflows/`: CI and automation

## Quick Start ⚙️

### 1. Prerequisites ✅

- Python 3.10+
- pip
- Groq API key

### 2. Clone and Install 📦

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KGFCH2/symptom-assist.git
cd symptom-assist
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment 🔐

Create `.env` in project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

### 4. Run the App ▶️

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints 🌐

- `POST /chat`: Main chat and reasoning orchestration endpoint
- `GET /graph-data`: Graph data for D3 visualization
- `POST /debug/analyse`: Internal diagnostics payload for debugging
- `GET /summary/{session_id}`: Visit-ready summary payload
- `POST /session/clear`: Reset session timeline state

## Development Notes 🛠️

- Keep `.env` and secrets out of version control
- Follow contribution conventions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Respect security guidance in [Security.md](Security.md)
- Use focused, single-purpose pull requests

## Testing 🧪

Run test suite:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Optional static checks in repository artifacts:

- `pylint.txt`
- `bandit.json`
