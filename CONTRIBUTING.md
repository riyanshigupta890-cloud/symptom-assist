## Code of Conduct
By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment. Please be respectful and constructive in all discussions and code reviews.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `app/` - The FastAPI backend, including core reasoning engines (`knowledge_graph.py`, `nlp_extractor.py`, `rag_pipeline.py`) and API routing.
- `data/` - Contains the dataset files `symptom_disease.csv` and `medical_docs.csv` powering the graph traversal.
- `static/` - Frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JS), including the D3.js powered knowledge graph UI.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please open an Issue on GitHub. Provide as much detail as possible, including:
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- Expected vs. actual behavior.
- Browser/OS version, or Python terminal traceback.

### Suggesting Enhancements
Have an idea for a new feature? We'd love to hear it! Open an Issue describing the feature, why it would be beneficial, and any potential implementation thoughts you have.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main` 
2. Ensure you have installed the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add relevant tests.
4. Update the `README.md` if your code changes the project's setup or interface.
5. Create a Pull Request with a clear description of the changes and mentioning the issue it fixes.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SymptomAssist-AI.git
   cd SymptomAssist-AI
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary API keys:
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   *Note: Never commit your `.env` file.*

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:8000` to interact with the UI.

## Coding Guidelines
- **Python:** Follow PEP 8 style guidelines. Include docstrings for all new significant functions/classes.
- **JavaScript:** Ensure modern ES6+ features are used appropriately, keeping performance in mind (especially regarding the D3 graph).
- Keep commit messages clear and concise (e.g., "Add timeout handling for groq API", "Fix CSS layout for graph nodes").

We appreciate your contributions!
